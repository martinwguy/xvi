POSIX compliance statement for xvi
----------------------------------

xvi has been run through the POSIX comformance test but it only makes
the editor write test files which it then examines; it does no testing
of the screen's appearance and much of what has been implemented in the
OpenGroup's POSIX test suite regards the ex command line, which is more
scantily implemented in xvi.

Xvi recognises the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable (which sets the
new "posix" parameter) and makes the following "common sense" changes to
its behaviour:

* Using the $ motion on an empty line is not an error.

* When you execute the contents of a character mode named buffer using
  :@ or :* commands, all lines are pasted newline-terminated instead of
  all but the last.
