  * Release 2.50.2. Five bug fixes:
    - Inserting chars in the middle of a command line got the display right but
      the inserted characters were omitted from the command
    - ^U to cancel a command line now clears the display too back to the :
    - "tc" now does not move if the character after the cursor is a "c"
    - Character maps are now applied to text stuffed with :@ or :*
    - Stuffing a character-based yank with :@ or :* adds a final newline
