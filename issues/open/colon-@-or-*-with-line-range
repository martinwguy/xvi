:@ and :* with a line range only execute the named buffer on the last line

They should execute the commands in the named buffer for each line in the range.

Repeat-by:
Put "s/a/b/" in buffer "a, create some lines with a's in them then :1,$@a
should change the first a on each line; instead it only changes the last line.
Similarly, 2,4@a ony changes line 4.

POSIX says:

"If no buffer is specified or is specified as '@' or '*', the last
buffer executed shall be used. If no previous buffer has been executed,
it shall be an error.

For each line specified by the addresses, set the current line ( '.' )
to the specified line, and execute the contents of the named buffer (as
they were at the time the @ command was executed) as ex commands. For each
line of a line-mode buffer, and all but the last line of a character-mode
buffer, the ex command parser shall behave as if the line was terminated
by a newline.

If an error occurs during this process, or a line specified by the
addresses does not exist when the current line would be set to it, or
more than a single line was specified by the addresses, and the contents
of the edit buffer are replaced (for example, by the ex :edit command)
an error message shall be written, and no more commands resulting from
the execution of this command shall be processed."
