When xvi runs out of memory, you can't save the buffer

When xvi runs out of RAM (like in issue #130) you can't write the file.
To ":w foo" it says "Cannot open preserve file /tmp/#foo.tmp".

If you force the write ``:w! foo"...

If you bypass the preserve file when forcing:

--- a/src/fileio.c
+++ b/src/fileio.c
@@ -612,7 +612,9 @@ bool_t     force;
     /*
      * Preserve the buffer here so if the write fails it will at

      */
-    if (need_preserve && !preservebuf(window)) {
+    if (!force && need_preserve && !preservebuf(window)) {
        return(FALSE);
     }

It says "Can't write foo" instead because the fopen() fails for lack of RAM.

Test using:
	(ulimit -v 2500; src/xvi)
	80aa[esc]
	yyppppppppppppp...  until it barfs
	:w foo
