The internal key codes for special keys mask valid characters

The codes for K_HELP, the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up/Down,
Insert, Delete, are 0x80 to 0x8c, which are valid accented characters
on MSDOS and can be the second char of UTF-8 characters.

For example, left arrow, \206, is the second char of the AE ligature
in UTF-8 and down arrow, \204, is a-grave on MSDOS CP437.

One idea is to use rarer character codes, say from 0xFF down.
F8-FF are impossible first char values in UTF-8 and rare chars in CP437
except for F8, which is the degree symbol.
Unfortunately, cmdtab.c currently relies on the codes being sequential
to ASCII, i.e. starting from 0x80.

Another answer is to widen the input character type and use values outside
the 0-255 range for the special key codes. That won't affect file lines
or what it remembers as the command line: the special chars are never
inserted into these but are acted on beforehand.
That would be more expensive on memory, but does pave the way for
UTF-32 support.
