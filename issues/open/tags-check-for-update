When the tags file changes, xvi carries on using the old one.

If the tag file is stale and doesn't index a new function, you can
(Control-Z, make tags, fg) and repeat the ^] but it still doesn't find it.

e.g. If you fail to find a tag because there isn't a tag file, suspend xvi
and "make tags", then foreground xvi and repeat the tag search, it
still doesn't find the tag until you say ":se tags=tags" to make it reread
the file.

Check the modification date or something, rather than having to say
:se tags=tags to force this.

It needs to check if the tag file has been updated since we read it or, on
systems that don't have datestamps, before doing a tag search, re-read the
tag file if the previous tag search failed.

Or we could check the modification date each time and update if it changes,
but causing disk activity all the time isn't so great.
