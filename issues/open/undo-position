After an undo, set the cursor position according to POSIX

xvi sets the cursor to where it was before the action being undone happened.

POSIX has a detailed description of what *it* wants, and xvi's current
strategy is not ideal. For example, you can't go undo-undo to go back to
the last thing you changed.

POSIX says, of the cursor position after an undo:
#
# "Current line:
#
#  Set to the first line added or changed if any;
#  otherwise, move to the line preceding any deleted text if one exists;
#  otherwise, move to line 1.
#
#  Current column:
#
#  If undoing an ex command, set to the first non-<blank>.
#
#  Otherwise, if undoing a text input command:
#
#  1. If the command was a C, c, O, o, R, S, or s command, the
#     current column shall be set to the value it held when the text
#     input command was entered.
#
#  2. Otherwise, set to the last column in which any portion of the
#         first character after the deleted text is displayed,
#     or, if no non-<newline> characters follow the text deleted
#         from this line, set to the last column in which any portion
#         of the last non-<newline> in the line is displayed,
#     or 1 if the line is empty.
#
#  Otherwise, if a single line was modified (that is, not added
#  or deleted) by the u command:
#
#  1. If text was added or changed, set to the last column in
#     which any portion of the first character added or changed
#     is displayed.
#
#  2. If text was deleted, set to the last column in which any portion
#         of the first character after the deleted text is displayed,
#     or, if no non-<newline> characters follow the deleted text,
#         set to the last column in which any portion of the last
#         non-<newline> in the line is displayed,
#     or 1 if the line is empty.
#
#  Otherwise, set to non-<blank>."

Which sounds like:

if undoing an ex-mode command, set to first non-blank of the line from the
  rules above.

For undoing vi commands:

if undoing a text-input command (which is the below and a i A I ?)
  if CcOoRSs, leave it to undo's current setting of the position,
    which is where the cursor was when text input mode was entered
  or on the following character following what you removed for the undo
    (cos AaIi always add text), sticking at eol
else
  if a single line was modified by the u command:
    if it added or changed text, set to last char of the added or changed text
    if it deleted text, set to first char after deleted text, sticking at eol
  "Otherwise set to non-blank" ???

what if several lines were modified by the command?
To the first non-blank of the modified lines?

What if I undo a vi-mode macro execution
(Though xvi doesn't currently implement undo of a map execution yet)?

Text input commands are, for xvi, the do_ins family [AIOaioK_INSERT]
while c is do-operator line d and y, s R r are do_cmd like P p
Add a flag to cmdtab TEXT_INPUT and remember it in the change structure
at start_command invocation level 0?

xvi differs from this:
- undoing a "%s/make/MAKE/" or "g/make/s//MAKE/" leaves the cursor at line 1
- When undoing an undo, it restores the cursor to where it was before the
  first undo.
- when deleting lines, it leaves the cursor on the line after the deleted
  text, not the one before.
