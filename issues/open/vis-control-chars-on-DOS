Control characters display as faces and sex signs on MS-DOS

In the edit buffer and on the command line, most of characters
1 to 31 display as single characters: funny faces and symbols.

They should display as ^A, ^M and so on.

For characters with the top bit set, this behaviour is OK
because it makes accented characters work.

This is because the default value of mchars on MSDOS is TRUE
but I would rather it displayed control characters and DEL as ^X
and top-bit-set character literally.
