When windows are resized, the current line is not maintained

When using ^T ^W ^O :equalise :split and their friends, at present
what was the current line can end up off the displayed region of the buffer
and xvi moves the cursor on-screen. It would be better if it kept the
current line the same and scrolled the window if necessary.
