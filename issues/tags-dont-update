It doesn't notice if the tags file is updated after a failed tag search

If you fail to find a tag because there isn't a tag file, suspend xvi
and "make tags", then foreground xvi and repeat the tag search, it
still doesn't find the tag until you say ":se tags=tags" to make it reread
the file.

It should maybe check the tags file's date always and update if it changes.
