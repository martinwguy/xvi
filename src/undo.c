/***

* program name:
    xvi
* function:
    Portable version of UNIX "vi" editor, with extensions.
* module name:
    undo.c
* module function:
    Code to implement "undo" command.
* usage:
    We provide several primitive functions for "do"ing things,
    and an "undo" function to restore the previous state.

    Normally, a primitive function is simply called, and will
    automatically throw away the old previous state before
    saving the current one and then making the change.

    Alternatively, it is possible to bracket lots of changes
    between calls to the start_command() and end_command()
    functions; more global changes can then be effected,
    and undo still works as it should.  This is used for the
    "global" command, for multi-line substitutes, and for
    insert mode.

    If a command fails, we should really back out of the whole
    transaction, undoing any changes which have been done.
    That we do not is not particularly harmful - we just leave
    it to the user to do it instead. It would be better if we
    did it automatically.
